# RBF Network 
---
##### Implementing Radial Basis Function Network w/ Python+NumPy to estimate sin of any number between 0 and 3 * PI

    usage: rbf.py [-h] [-s [SIGMA]] iterations num 
    
##### where `iterations` is the number of examples of `sin` available to the network, `num` is the number to estimate `sin(num)` and `sigma` a tuning parameter
